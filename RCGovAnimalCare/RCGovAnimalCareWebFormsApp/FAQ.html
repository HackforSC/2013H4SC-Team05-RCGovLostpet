<p><h5><a name="quest1">How do I file a complaint?</a></h5></p>
<p>You may file a complaint or request for service by calling the Ombudsman’s Office at (803) 929-6000.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><hr></p>
<p><h5><a name="quest2">What are the laws governing animal control in Richland County?</a></h5></p>
<p>You can find the complete text in chapter 5 of the <a href="http://www.amlegal.com/richlandco_sc/" target="_blank">Richland County Ordinances</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><hr></p>
<p><h5><a name="quest3">Do I need to license my pet?</a></h5></p>
<p>Residents of Richland County must obtain a license annually for their dogs and cats. See the <a href="License.html">Licensing</a> page on this website for requirements, fees and forms.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><hr></p>
<p><h5><a name="quest4">My neighbor’s dog barks constantly, what should I do?</a></h5></p>
<p>The first action you should take is to speak with your neighbor. You may be able to resolve the problem by discussing it with your neighbor. Your neighbor may not be aware that their dogs' barking is disturbing you. Dogs often bark when their owners are not home. If for some reason you are unable to resolve the problem by speaking with your neighbor, you should contact the Ombudsman's Office at (803) 929-6000 and file a complaint. The officer will either speak to the owners of the dogs or leave a  written notice advising the owners that a complaint has been made. If the problem is not resolved, the Animal Care Officer may issue a citation. You will be asked to testify in court.&nbsp; You will need to keep a written log of the barking.&nbsp; Date, time, frequency and duration of the barking is necessary in order to determine if the barking is excessive and unwarranted.&nbsp; A tape recording or video recording of the barking is also helpful.&nbsp; You will be asked to provide Animal Care with documentation and recordings before a citation is issued.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><hr></p>
<p><h5><a name="quest5">What can I do about loose dogs in my community?</a></h5></p>
<p>Pet owners in Richland County must not allow their pets to roam unrestrained. You may call Animal Care to remove the animal. Call the Ombudsman's Office at (803) 929-6000 and request to have your complaint investigated. If violations of the ordinances are found, a citation may be issued to the owner or the animal may be picked up. If the animal is picked up the owner pays fees and is issued a citation when redeeming the animal. If you know the owner's name or other contact information, it is very helpful to provide this information when you call.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a><hr></p>
<p><h5><a name="quest6">Who do I call if I am missing my animal?</a></h5></p>
<p>Call Animal Care at (803) 929-6000 and give a description of your pet along with your name, address, telephone numbers and the date your pet was last seen. Animal Care will determine if an animal that matches your description was picked up and impounded. It is difficult to identify mixed breed animals due to discrepancies and variations in descriptions. The best way to ensure the safe return of your lost animal is to have your pet licensed by the County.  If your pet is wearing a tag, you will be notified immediately. If the Officer is unable to access the pet tag information you will be notified by telephone as soon as the information is obtained. Please remember, animals will sometimes lose their tags. There is always a chance the collar may not be on when the animal is picked up.  You may view the animals currently housed in the <a href="animalviewer/View.html" class="Bodytext1">View Animals</a> page of this website. Contact Animal Care in reference to animals that may not have been posted due to injury or the health of the animal.  You may also view the bulletin board at 400 Powell Road for stray animals  picked up by Animal Care Officers.</p>
<p>You should also call or visit the animal shelters and veterinarians in your area.</p>

<p><h5><a name="quest12">Can I trap stray cats or dogs that come in my yard?</a></h5></p>

Animal Care will set a trap for wild animals such as raccoons, opossums, and squirrels if the wild animal is damaging your property or is a threat to humans. Only the use of humane traps is permitted.</p>
